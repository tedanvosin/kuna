//! (kuna `libctypes`) Named libc/POSIX aggregate types in the built-in prototype
//! tables — `FILE *` where the width-stable vocabulary can only say `void *`.
//!
//! [`super::Ty`] is width-stable by construction, so every aggregate pointer in
//! the two shipped tables is spelled `void *`: `fopen` returns one, `fclose`
//! takes one, `stat` fills one, `getopt_long` reads one. That is honest about
//! the width and silent about the pointee, and the pointee is the one thing the
//! table actually knows — `int fclose(FILE *)` is a declaration, not an
//! inference. This module carries the same signatures with the aggregate slots
//! named, plus the stdio entries whose only purpose is to name a parameter
//! (`int __uflow(FILE *)` is the sole type evidence a `-O2` coreutils reader
//! loop has for its stream argument).
//!
//! ## The shells are SIZED, and still incomplete
//!
//! A named shell of size 0 is not opaque, it is broken. `AddTreeState` has no
//! size-0 early out, and `RulePtrsubUndo`'s no-field arm short-circuits on
//! `typesize != 0` (`substrate/dtype.rs`), so a `PTRSUB` into a zero-size
//! pointee is declared MATCHING and survives to the printer, which renders it in
//! FUNCTIONAL form — literal `PTRSUB(p,0x28)` inside the C, on exactly the
//! `stdout + 0x28` and `f + 8` accesses this table exists to type. So each shell
//! carries its real glibc x86-64 width (`sizeof`/`_Alignof`, [`NAMED_AGGREGATES`]),
//! which makes an in-range access render `p->field_0x28` and an out-of-range one
//! fall back to the cast form.
//!
//! The shells are nevertheless kept INCOMPLETE (`flags::type_incomplete` is
//! passed back through `set_fields_struct_raw`, which re-ORs it), so the `.h`
//! emitter prints `typedef struct FILE FILE; /* opaque */` with no body rather
//! than a struct with a width and no members.
//!
//! The widths are the glibc **x86-64** ones, which is the ABI of the corpus this
//! option was measured on. On another ABI a width can be a few bytes off, and the
//! only thing that can change is whether an access at a given offset renders as a
//! field or as a cast — the NAME, which is the whole point, is ABI-independent,
//! and a wrong width can never make a pointer point at the wrong thing.
//!
//! ## `glibc` fills the shells in
//!
//! A sized, fieldless shell keeps the arithmetic seam honest and says nothing
//! about what is at an offset. The `glibc` value installs the PUBLISHED x86-64
//! members of the nine aggregates whose layout is part of the platform's API
//! ([`glibc::GLIBC_LAYOUTS`]), so `f->field_0x8` reads `f->_IO_read_ptr` and the
//! loaded value takes the FIELD's type. It is installed only on a target the
//! layouts are true of — an x86-64 ELF whose `.dynstr` names glibc — and the
//! shells stay opaque everywhere else. See [`glibc`] for the provenance and the
//! three rules those tables obey.
//!
//! ## A `-g` image already has the real thing
//!
//! On an image that carries debug info the platform's own `struct stat` is
//! interned with its real layout, and THAT is what this table points at — the
//! pass runs after `DwarfPass` for exactly that reason (`passes.rs`), and
//! [`named_aggregate`] adopts a held complete aggregate of the declared width
//! instead of minting a shell. glibc spells `FILE` as `struct _IO_FILE`, so that
//! alias is tried too; without it the image would carry two stream types and the
//! body would cast between them.
//!
//! The order is not cosmetic. A pointee is captured as an `Rc<Datatype>` when the
//! signature is built, and completing a struct re-keys it into a NEW `Rc`
//! (`TypeFactory::set_fields_struct` — the C++ mutates a `TypeStruct` in place,
//! the Rust clones). A shell minted first and completed by DWARF afterwards is
//! therefore completed for everyone EXCEPT the pointers this table already
//! built, and `st->st_mode` degrades to `*(int *)&st->field_0x18`. Running
//! second removes the window: this table never completes, re-keys or alters a
//! type it did not establish, and declines the signature outright when the name
//! is held by something else.
//!
//! ## Names are the bare DWARF spelling
//!
//! `FILE`, `stat`, `passwd`, … — not `struct stat`. kuna's printer spells a
//! named base bare and its `.h` emitter supplies the matching
//! `typedef struct stat stat;`, so the bare form is the one that round-trips
//! through `decompile-project`.
//!
//! ## Provenance
//!
//! Same rule as [`super::kuna_libcsigs`]: no signature here was written from
//! memory. The retargets restate a signature already in the shipped tables with
//! its aggregate slots named; each name new to this module was reduced from
//! `gcc -aux-info` over the platform headers with `_GNU_SOURCE` +
//! `_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2`. `__underflow` was REJECTED for want of one: glibc
//! declares it only in its internal `libioP.h`, which is not installed, so there
//! is no machine-readable declaration to reduce. `fgetc_unlocked` and `fmemopen`
//! were rejected on evidence instead — zero call sites across the 524 stripped
//! O0+O2 decbench ELFs, where every name kept here has at least 17 (`rewind` 117,
//! `__uflow` 77, `fgetc` 57; the census is in `docs/features/libctypes/`).
//!
//! ## The stream slots
//!
//! `stdin`/`stdout`/`stderr` are the one place this table types STORAGE rather
//! than a prototype slot, because the dynamic relocation that binds them says
//! what they hold: a copy-relocated `.bss` word is the stream pointer itself, a
//! GOT slot on an undefined symbol holds its address. See [`streams`].
//!
//! The `v*printf` family is the trap this table must not fall into: the last
//! `void *` of `vasprintf`, `vsnprintf`, `__vasprintf_chk`, `__vfprintf_chk`,
//! `__vsnprintf_chk`, `verr` and `vwarn` is a `va_list`, not a `FILE *`. A
//! blanket `VoidPtr -> NamedPtr` retarget would assert a false type at every one
//! of those call sites, so the retarget is enumerated by hand, slot by slot.
