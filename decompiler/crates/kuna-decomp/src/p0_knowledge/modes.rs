//! P0 -- decompiler MODES: named presets over the runtime option surface.
//!
//! A concrete *mode* is a named, ordered list of `(option, value)` overrides
//! layered on top of the shipped defaults, applied *before* any explicit user
//! `--option` (last-write-wins, so a user `--option` always overrides the
//! mode). A mode is **not** a `[[settable]]` row -- it references existing
//! option names and lives entirely in this table, so it never touches
//! `phases.toml` / `SETTABLE_TABLE` / the catalog count+tier gates. File
//! frontends resolve an omitted mode as the size-driven `auto` policy.
//!
//! Four modes ship:
//!   - **`auto`** -- a frontend policy that selects a concrete preset from the
//!     input binary's file size. It is not itself applicable to an
//!     [`Architecture`](crate::architecture::Architecture), which has no input
//!     file metadata.
//!   - **`reliable`** -- the shipped, well-tested defaults (a stable, named
//!     alias with an empty override list). Anchors the "give me the safe output"
//!     product surface and future-proofs the preset if defaults later drift.
//!   - **`aggressive`** -- turn on every off-by-default quality/recovery/analysis
//!     pass for the most-recovered (and slowest, most speculative) output. Two
//!     options are excluded (see [`AGGRESSIVE_OVERRIDES`]).
//!   - **`fast`** -- replace exhaustive discovery with a rooted recursive pass
//!     plus conservative pointer validation while retaining per-function transforms.
//!
//! Concrete presets are applied through `Architecture::apply_mode` (which fans
//! out to `set_kuna_option`). File frontends first resolve `auto` from binary
//! metadata; the interactive console has no file-size policy and accepts only
//! concrete presets.
